Instructions

Create four different responsive design styles for the HTML5 document (attached cv4.zip file).

Step:

    Finish the stylesheet (basic.css) for the page with quotations (index.html) for different device types (responsive design).
    Proceed according to requirements in comments (in the basic.css file).
    Create 3 styles according to the device width (referred to as narrow, normal and wide formats) and one style for print.
    Common parts of styling will be defined once, i.e. they will not be repeated in particular styles.
    In the print variant, standard paper size and white color of the paper will be considered; a font family suitable for print will be selected.
    Styles can be tuned in developer tools (e.g. F12 key in Chrome).
    Remember to reset and/or normalize your styles.

In images attached (cv4.zip) you can find previews of narrow, normal and wide formats.
