            	<li>Third party cookies: those that are sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain that is not managed by the publisher, but by another entity that processes the data obtained through the cookies.</li>

            </ol>
            <p>Finally, there is another classification with five types of cookies according to the purpose for which the data obtained is processed:</p>
